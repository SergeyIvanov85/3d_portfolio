# Hello everyone!

[This is my personal 3D Portfolio Website](https://sergeyivanov85.github.io/3d_portfolio/) with Three.js and React.js!

## Introduction
The most impressive websites in the world use 3D graphics and animations to bring their content to life. I built my own ThreeJS 3D Developer Portfolio! 
 
In this project, I used the following:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

## Also I`ve implemented:
- How to load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- How to make my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Sending emails through a form on the website
- Responsiveness across all devices and using Suspense and Preload.
